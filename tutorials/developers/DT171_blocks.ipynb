    "The first step is to ensure that what you want to implement is actually a block. \n",
    "The main utility of a block is that the order of operations can be changed.\n",
    "If this is useful for your module, then you should implement a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason to implement a block is if you want users to be able to add or\n",
    "remove steps from the block. For example, adding an activation function, or\n",
    "removing a dropout layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, remember that blocks shouls be small and modular. If you are implementing\n",
    "a block that is too big, you should consider breaking it down into smaller blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, blocks should be pretty strict in terms of input and output. This is \n",
    "important to ensure that the user has the flexibility to change the order of\n",
    "operations without breaking the model."
