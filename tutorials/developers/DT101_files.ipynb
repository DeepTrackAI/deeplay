These are jupyter notebooks that provide a comprehensive guide to the Deeplay library, focused on helping users and developers get started with, and make the most of the library. For now, this script should be run by the developer when a new style is added."

It is better to organize the codebase such that related objects are in the same folder instead of the same file.\n",

This is to prevent circular dependencies and make the codebase easier to understand. So, for example in the structure:\n",
