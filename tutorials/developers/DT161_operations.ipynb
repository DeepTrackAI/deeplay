    "\n",
    "The first step is to ensure that what you want to implement is actually an operation.\n",
    "Most operations are non-trainable, but this is not a strict requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of operations are `Reshape`, `Concatenate`, `Dropout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Some operations are trainable. This is useful if the standard constructor of a trainable layer is not well suited for Deeplay, or if a layer needs a custom forward pass. This is the case for attention layers, for example. In this case it's important to ensure that the operation is not actually a operation. If the module contains several layers, it should instead be implemented as a operation."
