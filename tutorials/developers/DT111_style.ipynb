    "## Complying with Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond what is defined in the PEP 8 guidelines, we have the following naming conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimize the use of abbreviations.** If an abbreviation is used, it should be well-known and non-ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use standard names for classes.** Use the following names:\n",
    "  - `layer` for a class that represents a single layer in a neural network, typically the learnable part of a block.\n",
    "  - `activation` for a class that represents a non-learnable activation function.\n",
    "  - `normalization` for a class that represents a normalization layer.\n",
    "  - `dropout` for a class that represents a dropout layer.\n",
    "  - `pool` for a class that represents a pooling layer.\n",
    "  - `upsample` for a class that represents an upsampling layer.\n",
    "  - `block` / `blocks` for a class that represents a block in a neural network, typically a sequence of layers.\n",
    "  - `backbone` for a class that represents the main part of a neural network, typically a sequence of blocks.\n",
    "  - `head` for a class that represents the final part of a neural network, typically a single layer followed by an optional activation function.\n",
    "  - `model` for a class that represents a full neural network architecture.\n",
    "  - `optimizer` for a class that represents an optimizer.\n",
    "  - `loss` for a class that represents a loss function.\n",
    "  - `metric` for a class that represents a metric.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Use underscored numbers when necessary.** If there is a naming conflict within a class, add numbers to the end of the name with an underscore, 0-indexed. For example, `layer_0` and `layer_1`.\n",
    "  - This is correct: `layer_0`, `layer_1`, `layer_2`\n",

    "## Using Type Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use type hints extensively.** This will make the code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type hints should be as specific as possible.\n",
    "For example, if a string can be one of several values, use a `Literal` type hint. \n",

    "We are currently supporting Python 3.8 and above. Some features of Python 3.9 are not supported yet, such as the `|` operator for type hints. You can get around this by importing `annotations` from `__future__`.\n",

    "Classes should have their attribute types defined before the `.__init__()` method. An example is shown below:\n",
    "\n",

    "    \"\"\"A class that does something.\"\"\"\n",

    "## Formatting Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use absolute imports.** This should be done for all imports, unless the target is at the same level in the hierarchy inside a `__init__.py`.\n",
    "For example, in `deeplay/external/optimizers/optimizer.py`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from deeplay.module import DeeplayModule  # Correct.\n",
    "from ...module import DeeplayModule  # Incorrect.\n",

    "from .optimizers import *  # Correct.\n",
