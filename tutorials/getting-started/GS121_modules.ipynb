However, most modules also have specific configuration methods that allow you to change specific properties. For example, the `LinearBlock` has the `.normalized()` and `.activated()` methods that allow you to add normalization and activation to the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, most configurations are applied to many layers at once. For example, you may want all blocks in a component to have the same activation function. There are a few ways to do this, but the most powerful of all is the selection system. This will be more thoroughly explained in [GS181 Configuring Deeplay Objects](GS181_configure.ipynb), but the basic idea is that you can select a subset of layers in a module and apply a configuration to them. This is done using the `.__getitem__()` method. For example, to apply an activation function to all blocks in a component, you can use the following code."
