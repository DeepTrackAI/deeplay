    """Self-supervised object detection using LodeSTAR

    Creates a trainable model for self-supervised object detection using the LodeSTAR method.

    Should be trained on a dataset of crops of objects. The model will learn to detect objects in the crops and
    output the coordinates of the center of the object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    optimizer: Optimizer
        Optimizer to use for training.
    model : nn.Module, optional
        Backbone model. Should return a tensor of shape (B, outputs + 1, H', W') where B is the batch size, outputs is
        the number of measures to predict, and H' and W' are the height and width of the output which do not have to
        match the input. If None, a default model will be used.
    num_outputs : int
        Number of outputs from the model. Should be 2 for x and y coordinates.
    transforms : Transforms, optional
        Set of transforms to apply to the input. If None, a default set of transforms will be used.
        These define the geometric transformations that the model will be consistent to.
    n_transforms : int
        Number of transformed images to use for training. The model will be trained to be consistent across these.
    between_loss : Callable, optional
        Loss function for between-image disagreement. If None, nn.L1Loss will be used.
    within_loss : Callable, optional
        Loss function for within-image disagreement. If None, nn.L1Loss will be used.
    between_loss_weight : float
        Weight for between-image disagreement loss.
    within_loss_weight : float
        Weight for within-image disagreement loss.
